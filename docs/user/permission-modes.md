# Permission Modes

A permission mode controls how much the agent does on its own and when it stops to ask you.

The mode is set per thread, from the mode control in the message composer. Changing it in one
thread does not change any other thread. A thread created from inside another thread keeps that
thread's mode; otherwise new threads start in **Full access** unless you pick something else
before sending.

## The Modes

**Supervised**: ask before commands and file changes. The agent pauses and shows you what it
wants to run or edit, and waits for approval. Work outside the workspace is restricted.

**Auto-accept edits**: auto-approve edits, ask before other actions. File changes go through
without prompting; commands and anything else still stop for approval.

**Auto**: routine actions proceed without you; risky ones still ask. How this is enforced depends
on the provider: Codex delegates routine approvals to an AI reviewer, Claude uses its own auto
permission mode, and providers without an equivalent (such as OpenCode) fall back to asking, like
Supervised. Droid allows edits and read-only commands in **Auto-accept edits**, adds reversible
commands in **Auto**, and only runs every command without prompting in **Full access**.

**Full access**: allow commands and edits without prompts. The default. The agent runs
unattended until it finishes or asks a question of its own.

For Droid, **Full access** selects its highest autonomy level. T3 Code does not pass Droid's
`--skip-permissions-unsafe` override.

Approvals appear inline in the conversation. Depending on the provider and request, rejecting one
may end the current turn instead of letting the agent continue in place.

## Choosing a Mode

Use **Full access** for work in a worktree or a sandbox you can throw away.

Use **Supervised** on a repository where an unwanted command is expensive, or the first time you
run an unfamiliar task.

**Auto-accept edits** suits refactors where the edits are the point and you only care about the
shell commands.

## Provider Behavior

Each provider maps these modes onto its own approval and sandbox settings. Codex, for example,
translates the mode into its approval policy and sandbox level, so **Supervised** runs the CLI
with prompting enabled and a restricted workspace while **Full access** disables both. The
labels above describe what you get; the exact per-provider translation is internal and may
change.

Mobile offers the same four modes with the same labels and descriptions.
